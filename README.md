02 CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

**Version 1.0.0**

## Task Description

The task for this week was to create a responsive website using Bootstrap's grid system. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that is commonly used by Web Developers to create nice look responsive websites for different screen sizes. The way users view websites has changed drastically of the last 10-20 or so plus years, in that users are now viewing websites on a variety of different devices and screen sizes including phones, tables, laptops & large monitors. It is important for a website to view and function well independent of what screen size it is being viewed on. This is the main reason for using Bootstrap's grid system, as it saves a lot of time and effort of developers when building responsive websites.

## Logo & Navbar

I decided to create a logo using my name to include in the navbar, rather than using decorated text. I styled the background colour of the navbar and the links to match the logo and made sure it fit nicely on a large screen. When viewing on a small screen, I had a bit of trouble getting the navbar links to drop down below the logo and stay centred. It took me a while, but finally I was able to produce the look and feel I wanted for the navbar using Chrome Developer Tools, then it was just a matter of applying that code to my HTML & CSS documents. Lastly, I added a dark orange hover colour to the links and made the logo a link as well to ensure a better user experience. I had the idea of creating a dark orange duplicate version of my logo, and having the image switch to the dark orange one when hovered, but I ran out of time to implement this.

## Index / About Me Page

I made the About Me page the home page for the website. I used a Bootstrap card to create the layout and I think it turned out qutie well on all screen sizes. I noticed when using the Card that it came with a nice curved preset border, which I then decided to apply to the Portfolio & Contact content to keep my website looking consistent.

## Contact Page

This page was probably the most straight forward to create. I used a single medium sized column inside a row and was able to easily mix and match the elements inside the contact form until I had something I liked. I added the same yellow colour I used for the links as a border inside the contact fields when the user clicks on them, so that the user knows they have that field selected.

## Portfolio Page

I used two 6 medium sized columns on this page inside a single row. At first I started with placeholder images and I was having trouble to get them to respond well when shrinking/increasing the browser size. After a bit of playing, I realised I needed to use the Bootstrap responsive image CSS which helped a lot. After I had the placeholder images looking nice, I replaced them with some nicer looking ones and went with a "Retro Game/Tech" theme. I added dummy links using href="#" to each image which I can later replace with real links to projects I have created. 

## Sticky Footer

As a bonus, I added a sticky footer at the bottom of the page. I used the same colour for the footer as I did with the navbar, however I made it transparent so it didn't completely block the content it was covering when scrolling on the page.
