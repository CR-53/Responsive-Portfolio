02 CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

**Version 1.0.0**

## Task Description

The task for this week was to create a responsive website using Bootstrap's grid system. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that is commonly used by Web Developers to create nice look responsive websites for different screen sizes. The way users view websites has changed drastically of the last 10-20 or so plus years, in that users are now viewing websites on a variety of different devices and screen sizes including phones, tables, laptops & large monitors. It is important for a website to view and function well independent of what screen size it is being viewed on. This is the main reason for using Bootstrap's grid system, as it saves a lot of time and effort of developers when building responsive websites.
